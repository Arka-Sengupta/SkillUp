## 🚀 **Project Overview**

SkillSwap is an innovative web-based platform that connects students and professionals across disciplines to **exchange knowledge and skills.** The platform fosters collaborative learning by matching users based on their expertise and interests, creating a dynamic skill-sharing environment.

### 🎯 **Problem Statement**
In today’s competitive academic and professional world, many individuals lack opportunities to learn and practice new skills. While courses and tutorials are abundant, the **human connection of peer-to-peer learning** is often missing.  
**SkillSwap** solves this by providing a platform where users can **learn from and teach each other,** creating a win-win situation.
